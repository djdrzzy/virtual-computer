So what is this software about? This is a quick and dirty project to get a
small and quick implementation of a computer up and running for use for other
projects. The main motivation was to be able to describe a computer in a
fashion that other programs can easily manipulate.

It has its own unique assembly language along with an assembler which you can
use to compile your program into the proper format so that you can program for
the computer in a human readable fashion.

There is a not-very-rigourous test suite that you can run.

And that is it! If there are any questions feel free to give me a shout.
